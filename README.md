# Flowly-Kafka

## Introduction

Flowly-Kafka is a Rust-based library designed to simplify interactions with Apache Kafka. This library provides a high-level abstraction for Kafka producers and consumers, making it easier to integrate Kafka into your Rust projects.

## Features

- **Async Producers and Consumers**: Utilizes asynchronous programming to handle message production and consumption efficiently.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized management of Kafka client configurations through a structured `Config` struct.
- **Logging and Error Handling**: Provides detailed logging options and robust error handling mechanisms.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to use Flowly-Kafka:

- async-stream
- bytes
- flowly
- futures
- log
- rdkafka
- serde (with derive feature)
- thiserror

## Usage

To get started with Flowly-Kafka, add the library as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
flowly-kafka = "0.1.0"
```

Then, you can use the library in your Rust project as follows:

```rust
use flowly_kafka::KafkaConsumer;
// Add other imports and initialization here

fn main() {
    // Initialize Flowly-Kafka with your custom configuration
    let config = /* construct your Configuration */;
    let kafka_client = KafkaConsumer::new(config);

    // Use the Kafka client to produce and consume messages
}
```

Refer to the library documentation for detailed API usage examples.
